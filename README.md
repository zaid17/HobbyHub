# HobbyHub

So many people every day seek a new sport or a hobby to learn, maybe they have
the extra time they want to fill or maybe they are bored, but the problem is that they
can't find communities around them or on the internet to learn from.
This project is about a new social media app that will help people join the hobby
communities to learn and share their experiences.
Chess, Basketball, Football, and Tennis are all hobbies that people do together,
doing these hobbies alone would be boring, and joining a community for a hobby
would make it more interesting and fun.
The Project name is Hobby Hub, this application will be a hub for a different hobby
communities, so they can communicate, learn and make a new network of people
with the same interests.
Hobby Hub will contain multiple hobbies, every hobby has its own part of the app
with its followers, members can follow different hobbies, and different members
with the same interests.
Hobby Hub is a University graduation project built using Software Engineering
approaches and this document is about showing our project building process and
apply what we have learned from the University as software engineers.
